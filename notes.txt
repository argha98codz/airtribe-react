1. useState
    Used to create a stateful reactive state (UI reacts to useState state changes)
2. State and props
    States are mutable while props are immutable.
3. Data in React passes from parent to child (no exception).
    Is there a way to pass data from child to parent? - Yes, via callbacks being invocked in the child
4. useEffect is a way to
    - Create a side effects after the component has rendered
    - Use useEffect when you want your components to be in sync (Syncing of data across components)
    - Optionally, you can also do API calls in your useEffect, but it is generally not recommended
